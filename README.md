# MAPL-Paper

Simulation results can be obtained by running the "MAPL_ALL.ipynb" notebook.

The "data" folder contains the simulation results from two experiments:

- The "data/compare-models" folder includes results from the primary simulation experiment where we compare the log-likelihood values of different models estimated on different data generating processes.
- The "data/compare-size" folder includes results from the sensitivity analysis simulation where we estimate the same MAPL model on the same data generating process but with increasing sample sizes.
